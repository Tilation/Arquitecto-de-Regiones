# Arquitecto-de-Regiones
As a C# WinForms developer, one eventually come across this problem:

I want my form to have round corners. But how?

And now, I present to you, Region Architect.

But, what does it do?
It's a companion for C# developers, who wants to create custom rendering regions for their UserControls or custom Forms; if you're making an application that it's corners are rounded, this tool could help you finish it faster.

Will I still have to write the messy GraphicsPath code?
Nope, the tool has a C# code generator that will output the exact lines of code to reproduce what you have created. (You still need to have some creativity though)

This is an internal tool I'm developing for my own projects, and I figured that if it was useful for me, well, it surely would for some of you :)
